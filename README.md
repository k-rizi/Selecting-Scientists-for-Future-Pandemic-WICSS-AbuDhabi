From January 8 to 19, 2024, The Institute at NYUAD sponsored the Winter Institute in Computational Social Science, held in person at NYU Abu Dhabi. The purpose of the Winter Institute was to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career faculty interested in computational social science. The Winter Institute was for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).
