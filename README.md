From January 8 to 19, 2024, The Institute at NYUAD sponsored the Winter Institute in Computational Social Science, held in person at NYU Abu Dhabi. The purpose of the Winter Institute was to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career faculty interested in computational social science. The Winter Institute was for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

### About the data we used:
The COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) is a comprehensive resource of scholarly articles on COVID-19 and related coronaviruses. Developed by the Allen Institute for AI, in collaboration with leading research groups, CORD-19 aims to facilitate the application of recent advances in natural language processing and computational techniques to generate new insights into the COVID-19 pandemic.
